# CS300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

This course involved importing data into data structures and manipulating the data.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

At the beginning of the course I was lost. I took to YouTube to find some tutorial videos and I had some luck. Concentrating on what I learned in those tutorials and paying attention to the announcements is imperative to success in this course. Data structures are extremely important to understand because they provide the basis for storing and manipulating data.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I took a lot of breaks to let my mind wander when I was stuck on a problem. Time away from the screen and sleeping on tough to tackle problems helped a lot.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

I think I did a good job implementing this code in a compact efficient form. I think I will be able to reuse some of the code in some personal projects.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

For the final project I tried to make everything clear, concise, and readable. I think that the program could be refactored into a wide range of applications for inputting and manipulating small data sets.
